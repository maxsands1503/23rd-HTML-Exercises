  <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>Well, I grew up in Boynton Beach, then went to collegein Gainesville.
       Then, I volunteered with Americorps and was stationed in Vickburg.
       I then volunteered with City Year, when I was living in Glendale, worked at Starbucks
       while living in Englewood, and now I live in Denver while I'm going to Galvanize.
