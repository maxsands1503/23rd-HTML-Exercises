  <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>Well, I grew up in Boynton Beach, then went to collegein Gainesville.
       Then, I volunteered with Americorps and was stationed in Vickburg.
       I then volunteered with City Year, when I was living in Glendale, worked at Starbucks
       while living in Englewood, and now I live in Denver while I'm going to Galvanize.

  <h1>Cities I'd Like to Visit</h1>
    <p>I've already been to Vancouver once and would love to go back. I'd like
       to visit another city in Canada, and I've heard good things about Montreal.
       And of course NYC is always a fun place to visit</p>
